      <p class="about-paragraph">
        The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method, created by Francesco Cirillo for a more
        productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to
        break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length,
        separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro,
        from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen
        timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
